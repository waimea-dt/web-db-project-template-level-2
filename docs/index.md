## Project Description

This project covers the development of a system that allows someone to track maintenance jobs for their bikes.

- Bikes can be added to the system
- Maintenance tasks can be defined for the bikes and added to the system
- Tasks can be one-offs or can be repeating ones
- Tasks that have not yet been completed are clearly listed
- Tasks can be marked as completed
- When a repeating task is marked as complete, it will be marked as incomplete again after a set amount of time
