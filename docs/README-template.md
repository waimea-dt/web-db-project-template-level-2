## Project Details

This is a digital media and database project for **NCEA Level 2**, assessed against standards [91892](as91892.pdf) and [91892](as91892.pdf).

The project is a web app that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) for the server back-end, connecting to a SQLite database to store and retrieve data. The database is hosted on the server and sync'd to [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for persistence. The app uses [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) templating for structuring pages and data, and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as the starting point for styling the web front-end.

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced database techniques**:
- Linking data in related tables or nodes using queries or keys
- Writing custom queries to filter and/or sort data
- Using logical, mathematical and/or wildcard operators
- Customising presentation of the data
- Using custom forms to add user input to the database
- Setting validation rules for data entry

The project demonstrates a number of **advanced digital media (web) techniques**:
- Creating or customising scripts, code or presets
- Using a combination of steps to manipulate or enhance elements
- Using a third-party library
- Using composite effects
